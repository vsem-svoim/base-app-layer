    ## Quality Scoring and Metrics Framework
    
    ### Composite Quality Score Calculation
    ```
    Quality Score Algorithm:
    
    Overall_Quality_Score = (
        (Completeness_Score * 0.20) +
        (Accuracy_Score * 0.25) +
        (Consistency_Score * 0.20) +
        (Timeliness_Score * 0.15) +
        (Uniqueness_Score * 0.10) +
        (Validity_Score * 0.10)
    ) * Business_Criticality_Weight
    
    Score Ranges:
    - 90-100: Excellent Quality (Production Ready)
    - 80-89:  Good Quality (Minor Issues)
    - 70-79:  Acceptable Quality (Monitoring Required)
